 * several times instead of only once will not impact the outcome) and that it does change over
 * time (typically, because another thread is busy doing something).
 *
 * @param pred a predicate function whose outcome we expect to become `true`
 * @param timeout the amount of time we are willing to wait, at most
 * @param sliceDuration how often to test the predicate; by default, 100 msec, should be a
 *      fraction of `timeout`; we will test `pred` at least once, if not.
 * @return whether `pred` outcome became true before `timeout` ran out, as soon as it does, with
