/**
 * A `View` is a mapping of the whole space of hashes onto a set of `Bucket`s, using
 * consistent hashing.
 *
 * The purpose of a `View` is to retrieve the `Bucket` which is closest to the given item's
 * hash: we do this in an efficient way by splitting the unity interval into a set of equal-sized
 * N intervals, where N is the smallest 2^x such that N > C log(C) and C is the number of expected
 * caches.
 *
 * To each `interval` we assign the buckets where at least one of their `hash_points` falls into
 * the interval: when finding the closest (ascending) bucket we only need to look into this
 * smaller subset of buckets (see the {@link bucket(const std::string&)} method).
 *
 * If no buckets have been allocated yet to that interval, we continue navigating the unit circle
 * until we find one.
 *
 * For more details, see the paper on Consistent Hashing, referred to in the documentation for
 * the `consistent_hash()` method.
