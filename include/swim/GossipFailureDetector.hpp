 * and report/detect health: a const reference can be retrieved via the
 * `#gossip_server()` method.
 *
 * <p>This detector runs several background threads that will __not__ be started at creation, but
 * __must__ be started after the embedded `SwimServer` is running (use `SwimServer::isRunning()`)
 * using `InitAllBackgroundThreads()`.
 *
 * <p>Each thread is responsibe for the various tasks that this detector must undertake:
 * <ul>
 * <li>`SendReport()` to other detectors, to report and detect failures;; and
 * <li>`GarbageCollectSuspected()` to remove "suspected" failed server, after the #grace_period()
 *      has elapsed.
